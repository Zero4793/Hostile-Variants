notes
mobs that put on light sources, break torches etc
creeper that has massive boom, slows,freezes all near mobs, has massive particle range and spooky sounds. all for scary ambienc and signal its approach as it is BIG boom
drowned that pulls player into the water
need to set scoreboard zero.age
raining arrows and ender are also broken
fix it so old boss stays, new are demoted
decrease guardian spawnrate
baby zombies grow into adult?



#have enderman summon dementor when angry? also only apply darkness/blindness when angry?
